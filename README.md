# A written analysis of the results
## Purpose of this analysis：
Lousie would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goal. We will use the kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on the launch dates and the funding goals and provide a written report based on the analysis.
## Analysis and Challenges:
By using the countifs function, I recognized the number of successful and failed campaigns for each dollar-amount range. Then by creating a line chart, we can easily visualize the trend between the different amount of goal verse the number of successful outcomes. Then we can identify the relationship between the goal amount and the outcome of the campaigns.

The challenges I am facing is to identify the goal amount follow the dollar-amount range. I choose to use if function to identify them.
## Results:
###### Conclusions from theater outcomes by launch date
1. May is the most successful launch month for Kickstarter campaigns.
2. January, March, September, November and December have the roughly the same number of failed campaigns.
###### Conclusions about the outcomes based on Goals
1.	When the goal set on 45000 to 49999, the outcomes have the highest failed rate.
2.	The campaigns have the highest successful rate when the goal is set under 1000.
###### limitations of this dataset
The result from outcomes by launch date and outcomes based on goals don’t show strong trends between successful and failed.
###### other possible tables
We can have a line chart between the campaign’s outcome vs. the subcategories.
